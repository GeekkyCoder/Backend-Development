// Middleware ? ğŸ¤”

// 1)Express app receives a request when someone hits a server for which it will create
// request and response.
// 2)middleware is used to manipulate request.
// 3)It is middleware because it is a function that run between request and response cycle.
// 4) middleware stack. middleware that appear first will run first.
// 5)middleware is like pipeline which end with response object.

// next() ? ğŸ¤”
// its the thrid paramter in middleware function, that calls the next middleware and so on, if we dont call the next() function , the server will be halted and sends a bad response to us

// try commenting out next() function and see ğŸ‘‡
